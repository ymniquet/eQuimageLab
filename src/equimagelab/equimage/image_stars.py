    The image is saved as a TIFF file (16 bits integer per channel); the stars are removed from this
    file with StarNet++, and the starless image is finally reloaded in eQuimageLab and returned.

    Warning:
      The command "starnet++" must be in the PATH.

    Args:
      midtone (float, optional): If different from 0.5 (default), apply a midtone stretch to the
        input image before running StarNet++, then apply the inverse stretch to the output starless.
        This can help StarNet++ find stars on low contrast, linear RGB images.
        See :meth:`Image.midtone_stretch() <.midtone_stretch>`; midtone can either be "auto" (for
        automatic stretch) or a float in ]0, 1[.
      starmask (bool, optional): If True, return both the starless image and the star mask.
        If False (default), only return the starless image [the star mask being the difference
        between the original image (self) and the starless].

    Returns:
      Image: The starless image if starmask is False, and both the starless image and star mask if
      starmask is True.
