    The image is saved on disk; the editor is then run on this file, which is finally reloaded in
    eQuimageLab and returned.

    The user/editor must simply overwrite the edited file on exit.

    Args:
      command (str): The editor command to be run (e.g., "gimp -n $FILE$").
        Any "$FILE$" is replaced by the name of the image file to be opened by the editor.
        Any "$SCRIPT$" is replaced by the name of the script file to be run by the editor.
      export (str, optional): The format used to export the image. Can be:

        - "png": PNG file with depth = 8 or 16 bits integer per channel.
        - "tiff" (default): TIFF file with depth = 8, 16 or 32 bits integer per channel.
        - "fits": FITS file width depth = 32 bits float per channel.

      depth (int, optional): The color depth (bits per channel) used to export the image
        (see above; default 16).
      script (str, optional): A string containing a script to be executed by the editor
        (default None). Any "$FILE$" is replaced by the name of the image file.
      editor (str, optional): The name of the editor (for pretty print; default "<Editor>").
      interactive (bool, optional): If True (default), the editor is interactive (awaits commands
        from the user); if False, the editor processes the image autonomously and does not require
        inputs from the user.
      cwd (str, optional): If not None (default), change to this working directory before running
        the editor.
