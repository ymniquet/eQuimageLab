Author: Yann-Michel Niquet (https://astro.ymniquet.fr)

### Installation

eQuimagelab is developed in Python 3. To install the latest version of eQuimagelab, open a linux terminal/windows command prompt and run:

  `pip install --user eQuimagelab`

pip will automatically download eQuimagelab and the missing python modules if necessary (matplotlib, etc...). You can then launch eQuimagelab by typing:

  `eQuimagelab`

in this same terminal. You can also create a link to eQuimagelab from your desktop; an icon is distributed for this purpose with the python package.
