Installation
------------

eQuimageLab is developed for Python 3 kernels.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the Python programming language and that Python 3 is installed on your machine.

The eQuimageLab package is available on `PyPI <https://https://pypi.org/project/eQuimageLab/>`_ (last stable release) and on `GitHub <https://github.com/ymniquet/eQuimage>`_ (development version).

To install the latest stable release, open a linux or windows shell and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --user eQuimageLab

pip will download and install the eQuimageLab package from PyPI, as well as all dependencies (JupiterLab, Plotly, Dash, Scikit-Image...). If you run Python in a virtual environment, you can remove the --user option.
